						<h3>Editorial Policy</h3>
						<p>
							At <strong>Troycity Africa</strong>, our primary goal is to provide valuable information and
							insights for marketers.
							To achieve this, we have a comprehensive editorial policy in place that drives our content
							creation process.
						</p>

						<p>The process of content creation goes through several stages which include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Research</li>
							<li>Writing</li>
							<li>Editing</li>
							<li>Fact-Checking</li>
							<li>Creating Images</li>
							<li>Publishing</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>1. Research Process</h4>
						<p>Good research is the foundation of our articles. Our research process is systematic and
							designed to create fresh and engaging content:</p>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Identify the topic:</strong> We select topics relevant to our readers, often
								focusing on a specific macro category (e.g., Branding). Once finalized, we explore
								subtopics to ensure readers have complete information at their disposal.</li>
							<li><strong>Secondary research:</strong> We gather data from credible sources — company
								reports, financial statements, academic journals, and industry publications — ensuring
								accuracy and relevance.</li>
						</ol>

						<h4>2. Writing Process</h4>
						<p>Good writing is as important as good research. We ensure quality content by following these
							steps:</p>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Outline creation:</strong> After research, we prepare a structured outline that
								logically develops the topic from basics to advanced points.</li>
							<li><strong>Drafting the article:</strong> Articles are written by the Troycity Africa team
								and primarily authored by <strong>Victor Nadebu</strong>, CEO of Troycity Africa, who
								integrates case studies and real-world examples.</li>
							<li><strong>Editing:</strong> The content team reviews drafts to fix grammar, typos, and
								clarity issues.</li>
						</ol>

						<h4>3. Fact-Checking Process</h4>
						<p>Accuracy and trustworthiness are key. Our editing team follows a strict fact-checking
							process:</p>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Verifying sources:</strong> We rely only on credible, cross-checked references.
							</li>
							<li><strong>Data validation:</strong> Financial and statistical claims are double-checked
								with company statements and authoritative publications.</li>
							<li><strong>Final review:</strong> The editorial team ensures all facts, references, and
								attributions are accurate before publishing.</li>
						</ol>

						<p>
							This systematic process ensures our readers receive high-quality, accurate, and engaging
							content.
							Our mission is to make <strong>Troycity Africa</strong> the number one trusted source of
							marketing insights online.
